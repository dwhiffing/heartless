tower defense ideas
  1
    - take turns laying down walls
    - try to lead creeps into your base

  2
    - one player builds towers
    - other players vote on next wave

  3
    - all entities can be taken over by a spectator instead of being controlled by ai
    - can aim towers manually, can draw creep paths manually.etc
