# Ideas
  Various ideas for the game
## Hearts
  - at first, shooting should do no damage to the player, but the longer they use a weapon, the more each shot damages them
  - when landing with white hearts and all others are pure or secondary, treat whites as wild card

### Pure hearts
  Having a pure set of hearts should give some kind of extra bonus:
    * White: never does any damage to player and stuns enemies
    * Red: shots explode and are huge
    * Yellow: shoots extremely quickly
    * Blue: spreads to cover entire arena

### Secondary hearts
  Having an equal amount of two primaries with none of the other causes secondary effects:
    * Orange: laser
    * Green: splitter
    * Purple: poison cloud

### Recipes
  There should be a variety of heart recipes for various powerups
  these are temporary power ups you can get by getting special amounts of each heart before consuming
    * invincible (3 red, 3 blue) - Purple
    * keep combo through jumps (3 Yellow, 3 Red) - Orange
    * double hearts (3 Yellow, 3 Blue) - Green
    * double points (3 Red, 3 Yellow, 3 Blue) - Black

## Jump
  * When jumping on enemies, gravity should get stronger over time to make it harder, but it should start easy

### Jump enhancment
  When consuming, player should be tinted based on the hearts consumed, enhancing that jump
    * Red: explode on landing
    * Yellow: move faster in air
    * Blue: fall slower
    * Purple: ?
    * Green: ?
    * Orange: ?

## Enemies
  Each colour should have an air based counter part that attacks from above periodically (These appear later in the game to make things harder)
    * Red: places itself diagonally in front of player and periodically shoots, player must jump on it while it is shooting
    * Yellow: swoops down at player, must jump at the right time to land on it
    * Blue: shadow slowly grows over area, blue falls and damages/stuns player if nearby
  Enemies should be able to jump, they should blink for a few moments before doing so
  Enemies should be able to shoot, they should blink for a few moments before doing so

## Misc
  - debug keys to add:
    - show physics bodies of player and enemy (either or both, p/o)

  - Moon phases for each colour:
     - spawn rates, player damage, amount of damage player takes per shot

  - Need to bring sfx back
  - Need more interesting spawning, maybe way to specify specifics waves
  - Need to fix scope polluting
